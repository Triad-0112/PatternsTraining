# Factory Method Python

## EXPLANATION
**Factory method** is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes.

**Factory Method** defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead of direct constructor call (**new** operator). Subclasses can override this method to change the class of objects that will be created.

## CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE
This example illustrates the structure of the Factory Method design pattern. It focuses on answering these questions:

>* What classes does it consist of?
>* What roles do these classes play?
>* In what way the elements of the pattern are related?
