# Iterator Golang

## EXPLANATION
**Iterator** is a **behavioral design** pattern that allows sequential traversal through a complex data structure without exposing its internal details.

Thanks to the **Iterator**, clients can go over elements of different collections in a similar fashion using a single iterator interface.

## CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE
The main idea behind the Iterator pattern is to extract the iteration logic of a collection into a different object called iterator. This iterator provides a generic method of iterating over a collection independent of its type.
